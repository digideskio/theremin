Theremin Tutor
==============

Fork of Yu Jiang's theremin for the leap motion. Includes a simple tutor - follow the red dot to play the Midsomer Murder's theme tune or Green Sleeves. Hosted at [numenore.co.uk/theremin](http://numenore.co.uk/theremin).

You can see the [Theremin Tutor on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUpbgP74tak&feature=youtu.be), or someone [playing it properly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTZK9FNgK74).

Everybody knows the theremin is the coolest instrument in the world! The only reason they haven't caught on is they are not readily available and they are hard to learn. Between Yu Jiang and Leap Motion, the first problem has been solved! This simple tutor solves the second.
